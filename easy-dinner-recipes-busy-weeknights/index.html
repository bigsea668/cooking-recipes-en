<h3 id="lemon-herb-roasted-chicken-and-veggies">Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken and Veggies</h3>

<h3 id="speedy-chicken-stir-fry">Speedy Chicken Stir-Fry</h3>
<p>Stir-fries are incredibly fast and customizable. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and stir-fry with your favorite vegetables (bell peppers, onions, snap peas, broccoli) in a wok or large skillet. Use a pre-made stir-fry sauce or create your own with soy sauce, honey, ginger, and garlic. Serve over rice or noodles.  Prep your ingredients <em>before</em> you start cooking – this is key to a quick stir-fry.</p>

This is a great way to minimize cleanup.</p>
<h3 id="creamy-garlic-shrimp-pasta">Creamy Garlic Shrimp Pasta</h3>
<p>Sauté shrimp with garlic and butter, then toss with cooked pasta and a creamy sauce made with heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and a squeeze of lemon juice.  This feels fancy but is surprisingly easy to make.  Use pre-peeled and deveined shrimp to save time.  Consider adding spinach or asparagus for extra nutrients.</p>
<h3 id="lemon-garlic-pasta-with-spinach">Lemon Garlic Pasta with Spinach</h3>
<p>A light and refreshing pasta dish. Cook pasta according to package directions. While pasta cooks, sauté garlic in olive oil, add spinach and cook until wilted. Toss with cooked pasta, lemon juice, zest, and Parmesan cheese. A simple yet satisfying meal.</p>
<h2 id="fast-flavorful-ground-beef-recipes">Fast &amp; Flavorful Ground Beef Recipes</h2>

<h3 id="sloppy-joes">Sloppy Joes</h3>

<h2 id="vegetarian-easy-dinner-recipes">Vegetarian Easy Dinner Recipes</h2>
<p>Don't worry, meat-eaters! These vegetarian options are just as quick, easy, and delicious.</p>
<h3 id="black-bean-quesadillas">Black Bean Quesadillas</h3>
<p>Spread black beans, cheese, and your favorite toppings (salsa, avocado, sour cream) on a tortilla. Fold in half and cook in a skillet until golden brown and the cheese is melted.  A quick and easy vegetarian meal that's perfect for lunch or dinner.</p>
<h3 id="quick-veggie-curry">Quick Veggie Curry</h3>
<p>Use pre-cut vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, peas) and a jar of curry sauce. Sauté the vegetables, then add the curry sauce and simmer until heated through. Serve over rice.  This is a great way to use up leftover vegetables.</p>
